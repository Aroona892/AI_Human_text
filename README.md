# 🤖 AI_Human_text

This project aims to distinguish between **human-written** and **AI-generated** text using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, this tool helps identify and verify the authenticity of digital communication.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

With the rise of large language models (like GPT), it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated text. This project provides a framework to build and evaluate models that can detect whether a given piece of text is written by a human or an AI.
